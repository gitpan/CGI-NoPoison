NAME
    CGI::NoPoison - No Poison Null Byte in CGI->Vars

SYNOPSIS
            use CGI;
            use CGI::NoPoison

            my $m = CGI->new();
            $m->param(
                    -name=>'amplifier',
                    -value=>['nine', 'ten', 'up to eleven'],
            );
            my %h = $m->Vars();
            # look ma, no splitting on poison null-bytes ( '\0' )!
            print "$_ => ", join ", ", @{$h{$_}} for keys %h;
   
            print "This one goes ", ($m->param('amplifier'))[2];

DESCRIPTION
    Simplicity itself. Instead of using a null-byte to separate multi-valued
    fields why not just use what CGI.pm already uses to store the values
    internally?

    "What's that?", you ask? Why, it's an anonymous array, of course, like
    anyone sensible would use. cgi-lib.pl may have been fine years and years
    ago, but this now-archaic throwback no longer needs us to bow to its
    demands. (is anyone still actually using it? yikes.)

    This does, however change how you parse CGI->Vars() (as an anon-array,
    not a "\0"-packed string) and also how you set params.

    NOW you can properly test for inserted null-bytes in a secure
    environment WHILE taking advantage of the convenience of the Vars()
    function.

USAGE
    Include the 'use CGI::NoPoison' only after you've already done 'use CGI'
    so that it can replace the AUTOLOAD routines with these replacement
    functions instead.

    (By the way, the CGI.pm internal functions that we replace are:
    CGI::SplitParam, CGI::STORE, and CGI::FETCH, not that you'd actually
    ever use these directly :)

    Then, all you have to do is remember that anywhere you would have
    previously used "\0" to split on, or to string-pack, just take an array
    reference, or use an anonymous array instead. See the CGI module
    documentation for details.

BUGS
    None so far. :)

    Well, this may actually be a pretty wonky way of replacing those
    functions in CGI.pm, but hey, it worked here. YMMV. :D

SUPPORT
    Yer on yer own with this one. Hopefully Lincoln Stein will get around to
    adding this as a -nopoison pragma to CGI.pm at some point.
